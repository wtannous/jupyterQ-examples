# jupyterQ-examples
Examples of use cases for jupyterQ to implement of python libraries within q, with the use of embedPy.

I have implemented the following examples:
1) K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering (sci-kit learn) (Dataset from SuperDataScience -https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/)
2) Apriori, Association Rule Learning to create association rules for supermarket purchases.  (Python algorithm from https://pypi.org/project/apyori/ - Dataset from SuperDataScience) ** Work in Progress **
3) Solving a Multi-armed bandit problem, choosing the best advertisement - Reinforcement Learning (Dataset from SuperDataScience)
      
      a) Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm
      
      b) Thompson Sampling
